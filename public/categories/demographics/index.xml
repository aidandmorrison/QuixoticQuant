      <description>The position of a small bar-owner I&#39;m one of the owners of a local neighbourhood cafe/bar/restaurant in Eastern Sydney. We&#39;ve recently been hit by Covid-19 restrictions, which meant that we lost over half of our revenue, despite aggressively pivoting towards take-away and delivery. We&#39;ve been going through some tough negotiations with our landlord about how much rent should be paid now and later. Overall, the outlook was pretty gloomy. In a welcome burst of good news, we heard that our local council was going to trail extending trading hours in our area for venues like ours, from midnight to 1am.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post I took a swipe at the likes of NAB, the RBA, Bernard Salt at KPMG, the ABS themselves, Business Insider, and Macrobusiness for their persistent failure to mark a sweeping definition-change that completely broke the continuity of the migration data they were reporting. I should write to them all and apologise for the fuss, because their indiscretion has been completely overshadowed by the perhaps the most ghastly abuse of data I’ve ever seen.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow-on to Dr. Cameron Murray’s reply to my first post on migration. In my first post I published the following graph demonstrating that Australia’s population included a ‘missing million’ people who we counted as resident, but who were actually overseas at any given time.

      <title>Discovering the Part-Time Population: Speed and Seasonality</title>

      <description>This post is a follow-on from my second post on migration, where I made the proposition that the true level-shift which warranted discussion was actually in international mobility, rather than Australia’s inward migration. I described conceptually how the definition of migration (which I’d discussed in detail in my first post) would inevitably lead to Australia registering a high migration rate while mobility was increasing globally, since we were naturally more likely to be a long-trip destination than a short-trip destination.</description>

      <title>The state of debate: A bird’s-eye on migration</title>

      <description>This post is a follow-on from my first post on this topic. In that post I pointed to a couple of alternative statistics which can be derived from ABS data, including “Net Overseas Movements”, and “Physically Present Population”. I suggested Australia’s migration rate might be substantially overstated by “Net Overseas Migration” (NOM), and the derived “Estimated Resident Population” (ERP) might also look bit frothy, or even a million people frothy according to ABS data.</description>

      <title>The Missing Million: Is Australia&#39;s migration rate actually high?</title>

      <description>It’s time that someone took a proper tilt at Australia’s high migration rate. No, I don’t mean like Dick Smith, splashing millions on an advertising campaign arguing that such a high rate is unsustainable and that we should return down to previous levels. I mean taking a few hours with the data source to figure out whether Australia’s migration rate actually is any higher than it was at previous levels.</description>
